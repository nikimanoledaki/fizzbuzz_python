# FizzBuzz in Python

## Description
The FizzBuzz kata, written and test-driven in Python. I learned Python independently as a week-end project. 

I was inspired to learn how to write tests using pytest for Python after I came across [this article](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932) from the Code Like a Girl blog.

## Getting started

Ensure that you have [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#getstarted) installed:
```
$ pip install pytest
```

Then, clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nikimanoledaki/fizzbuzz_python.git
```

## Run the tests
Then run the test for this project by running ``pytest``.
```
$ pytest
```
