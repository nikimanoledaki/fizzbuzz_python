# FizzBuzz

## Description
The FizzBuzz kata, written and test-driven in Python. Learning Python independently with the skills I learned from Makers was a little week-end pet project of mine. I was inspired to learn how to TDD Python after I came across [this article](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932) from the Code Like a Girl blog.

## Run it
```
~ python fizzbuzz.py

q: quit
Pick a number, any number:
```

## Test it
Ensure that you have [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#getstarted) installed:
```
pip install -U pytest
pytest --version
```

Then run pytest inside the folder to check that tests pass:
```
pytest
```
