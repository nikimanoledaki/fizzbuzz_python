# FizzBuzz

## Description
The FizzBuzz kata, written and test-driven in Python. Learning Python independently with the skills I learned from Makers was a little week-end pet project of mine. I was inspired to learn how to TDD Python after I came across [this article](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932) from the Code Like a Girl blog.
